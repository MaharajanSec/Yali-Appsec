## Quick start

Clone and install:

# Headscan

A small, friendly header checker for beginners ‚Äî quick AppSec triage for HTTP response headers and cookie flags.

(.venv) PS D:\yalitech\Yali-Appsec> python headscan.py https://example.com

https://example.com  -> HTTP 200
Overall quick risk: HIGH

Missing headers (simple explanation and quick fix):
 - Content-Security-Policy: Controls what websites (scripts, images, frames) your page can load.
   Quick fix: Add a CSP that allows only your site and needed services (start with: default-src 'self').
 - X-Content-Type-Options: Stops browsers guessing file types, which can prevent some attacks.
   Quick fix: Set header: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
 - X-Frame-Options: Prevents other sites from embedding your page (clickjacking protection).
   Quick fix: Set header: X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN (or use CSP frame-ancestors).
 - Strict-Transport-Security: Tells browsers to always use HTTPS for your site (safer connections).
   Quick fix: Set header: Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
 - Referrer-Policy: Controls how much URL info is sent when users click links to other sites.
   Quick fix: Set header: Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
 - Permissions-Policy: Lets you turn off browser features like camera or microphone for your site.
   Quick fix: Set a simple one: Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), camera=(), microphone=()

Cookies:
 - no Set-Cookie header seen

-> Advice: This site has high-risk gaps. If it's your site, apply the quick fixes above now.

Tip: For real confirmation, open the site in a browser and check Network ‚Üí Response Headers.
(.venv) PS D:\yalitech\Yali-Appsec> python headscan.py https://owasp.com

https://owasp.com  -> HTTP 200
Overall quick risk: LOW

All the checked headers are present (good).

Cookies:
 - no Set-Cookie header seen

-> Advice: Low risk from these checks. Continue monitoring.

git clone https://github.com/MaharajanSec/Yali-Appsec.git
cd Yali-Appsec

# create & activate virtualenv (Windows PowerShell)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run a quick scan:
python headscan.py https://example.com

You can also scan multiple sites from a file (one URL per line):
python headscan.py -f urls.txt

What it checks (plain language)

The tool looks for common security headers and cookie flags:

Content-Security-Policy ‚Äî controls what external scripts/images/frames the page can load.

X-Content-Type-Options ‚Äî prevents MIME sniffing (nosniff).

X-Frame-Options ‚Äî prevents clickjacking (or use CSP frame-ancestors).

Strict-Transport-Security ‚Äî tells browsers to always use HTTPS.

Referrer-Policy ‚Äî controls what URL data is sent to other sites.

Permissions-Policy ‚Äî controls browser features like camera/microphone.

Cookie flags ‚Äî checks if cookies include Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite.

The script prints friendly messages like VULNERABLE / WARNING / OK style lines to help non-experts understand.
