## Quick start

Clone and install:

# Headscan

A small, friendly header checker for beginners ‚Äî quick AppSec triage for HTTP response headers and cookie flags.

---

## Quick start

Clone the repo and prepare a Python virtual environment:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/MaharajanSec/Yali-Appsec.git
cd Yali-Appsec

# create & activate virtualenv (Windows PowerShell)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run a quick scan:
python headscan.py https://example.com

You can also scan multiple sites from a file (one URL per line):
python headscan.py -f urls.txt

What it checks (plain language)

The tool looks for common security headers and cookie flags:

Content-Security-Policy ‚Äî controls what external scripts/images/frames the page can load.

X-Content-Type-Options ‚Äî prevents MIME sniffing (nosniff).

X-Frame-Options ‚Äî prevents clickjacking (or use CSP frame-ancestors).

Strict-Transport-Security ‚Äî tells browsers to always use HTTPS.

Referrer-Policy ‚Äî controls what URL data is sent to other sites.

Permissions-Policy ‚Äî controls browser features like camera/microphone.

Cookie flags ‚Äî checks if cookies include Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite.

The script prints friendly messages like VULNERABLE / WARNING / OK style lines to help non-experts understand.
